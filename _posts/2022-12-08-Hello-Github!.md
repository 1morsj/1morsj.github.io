## On Github

I have finally moved to github after few years of trying to move to static websties. I have been trying to move to netlify, but then decided to go with github pages instead.

I am not entirely sure how many blogging platforms I have used so far. I was very briefly on LiveJournal before committing myself to Blogger and then I changed to wordpress.org and then to a selfhosted wordpress instance on shared hosting before finally moving to a VPS server.

I feel my interest in blogging is to understand the platform rather than to write and since I haven't done much on wordpress in the last few years, I feel it is time for me to move again, and this could a nice challenge. 

I will start moving my old posts over time and maybe I will write more now.
